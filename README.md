ExtendedMath
============

For all of those math functions that PHP lacks.

## Installation

Add this to your composer.json and update:

    "mcordingley/extended-math": "dev-master"

This will eventually switch over to using semantic versioning,
but it makes little sense to do so while this is in early
development.
