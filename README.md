ExtendedMath
============

[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/repositories/mcordingley/ExtendedMath.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/mcordingley/ExtendedMath)

For all of those math functions that PHP lacks.

## Installation

Add this to your composer.json and update:

    "mcordingley/extended-math": "dev-master"

This will eventually switch over to using semantic versioning,
but it makes little sense to do so while this is in early
development.

## Use

This package introduces a number of mathematical functions into the global PHP
namespace. It aspires to be a shim for these functions in the language. Functions
are separated into different files by type and are all commented with phpdoc
blocks. Please see the individual files for functional documentation.
